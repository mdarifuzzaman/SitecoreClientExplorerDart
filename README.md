# SitecoreClientExplorer

I have hardcoded every setting related stuff in "AppConst" class. If you want to run this in your environment, make sure you have changed those values accordingly.
Also make sure you sitecore instance is binded to your local ip so that from android/iphone, applcation can be able to access that.
